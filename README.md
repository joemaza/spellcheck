# Spellcheck
Collections of affixation rules, stems and other morphological operations (AKA "dictionaries") for Philippine languages for use with the [Hunspell](https://github.com/hunspell) spell checker and morphological analyzer.

# Current Languages
* [Iloko](dictionaries/ilo) (ilo) - *Currently in development*
  * Currently in active development
  * The approach creating affix classes for Iloko will be applied to other languages once they are finalized in this language. Areas in focus are:
    * Reduplication
    * Infixation
    * Left-word-edge affixation, i.e, prefixation (These languages are left-word-edge heavy)
  * Test packages are functional:
      - [Mozilla Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/)
      - [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/)
      - [DSpellCheck](https://github.com/Predelnik/DSpellCheck) ([Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/))

* [Tagalog](dictionaries/tgl) (tgl) - *Under Research*
  * Morphology (major, productive affixes) under investigation
  * Need to contact linguist specializing in Tagalog morphology
  * Test approach used with Iloko to be tested with experimental dictionary

* [Cebuano](dictionaries/ceb) (ceb) - *More Research Required*
  * More research necessary
  * Need to contact linguists specializing in Cebuano morphology
  * Need to investigate which dialect/variant orthography is considered *standard*
