# Morphological Summare
* Words often fill categorical roles in phrases, i.e., words are not easily classed into only one category.
* Reduplication is productive and is used to encode varying grammatical categories and for derivation. Common scenarios:
    - Full word, e.g., *bahay-bahay* (< bahay) *toy house*
    - First syllable: V~, CV~, CCV~ (Foreign words)
* Prefixation heavy
* Infixation is common, e.g., ⟨in⟩, ⟨um⟩, etc.
* Suffixation: only two are indigenous ⟨-an⟩, ⟨-in⟩. Other suffixes are of Spanish origin, a number of which are productive, e.g., ⟨-ero/a⟩
* Circumfixation: Prefix-Suffix, Infix-Suffix, Prefix-Prefix-Suffix, etc.
* Syncope is not common. Occurs on the ultima with suffixation and depends the primary stress.
* Assimilation of ⟨-ng⟩ common. Progressive assimilation and coalescence is predictable from the left-word edge segment.
* The various affixation processes listed above can co-occur.
