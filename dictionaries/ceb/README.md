# Introduction
Cebuano (also Bisaya, Binisaya, Sebuano, Sugbuanon) (ISO: [ceb](https://www.ethnologue.com/language/ceb)) is a Austronesian language primarily spoken in the Visayas region of the Philippines and in Mindanao, and it is the second most spoken after Tagalog (or, its register Filipino). Cebuano dialectology is quite diverse with some dialects considered separate languages by language autorities and linguists. Cebu City dialect is considered standard (per Wikipedia), however.
