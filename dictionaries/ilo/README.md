# Morphological Summary
* Words often fill categorical roles in phrases, i.e., words are not easily classed into only one category.
* Reduplication is productive and is used to encode varying grammatical categories and for derivation. Common scenarios:
    - Full word, e.g., *balay-balay* (< balay)
    - Partial word, e.g., *patempateg* (< pateg)
    - First syllable: V~, CV~, CCV~, VC~, CVC~, CCVC~
* Prefixation heavy
* Infixation is common, e.g., ⟨an⟩, ⟨in⟩, ⟨inn⟩, ⟨um/imm/im⟩, etc.
* Suffixation: only two are indigenous ⟨-an⟩, ⟨-en⟩. Other suffixes are of Spanish origin, a number of which are productive, e.g., ⟨-ero/a⟩
* Circumfixation: Prefix-Suffix, Infix-Suffix, Prefix-Prefix-Suffix, etc.
* Syncope is common. Loss of the vowel ⟨e⟩ or the vowel befor or after a geminated consonant, in the first or last syllable due to affixation.
* Assimilation or Coalescence of ⟨-ng⟩ of prefixes
* Pronouns are enclitic and can combine with various lexical categories.
* Three adverbial particles: ⟨-(n)to⟩, ⟨-(n)sa⟩ and ⟨-(e)n⟩.
* Processes listed above can co-occur.
